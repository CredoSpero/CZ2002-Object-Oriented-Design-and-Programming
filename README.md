Hard Rock Cafe is a restaurant of its own kind, offering a wide range of cuisines and flexible 
meal combinations. Customers enjoy dishes like Premium Tomato, Extra Premium Lollipops, 
and Surprise Sets, and enjoy the ever-changing and customised menu even more. The attractive 
member perks are another one of Hard Rock Cafe’s strengths. 

Hard Rock Cafe’s entry into the market was well-received and met with record-breaking levels 
of demand in their first quarter of operations, largely due to their top quality cuisine, great 
ambience and excellent customer service. This has posed significant challenges to the chefs and 
service crew who struggle to keep up with the surge in customer traffic. A significant portion of 
time and manpower was previously allocated to manually recording customer orders and 
attending to bill requests.

To accommodate this overwhelming demand, the restaurant has employed the help of 5 NTU 
students to develop a Restaurant Reservation Point of Sale System. The application serves to 
computerise the processes of making reservations, recording of orders and displaying of sale 
records, and is fully operated by restaurant staff
